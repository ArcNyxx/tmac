.SH NAME
troff_mla \- "mla" macro package for formatting documents with troff
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtroff -mla\fR \fIfile\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fImla\fR package of macro definitions for the \fIroff\fR language provides
a convenient facility for preparing MLA formatted documents.  The MLA
specification defines page margins of exactly 1 inch, paragraph indents and
hanging indents (for citations) of exactly 0.5 inches, centred titles and
specific page headers, and named pagination.
.PP
Pagination is applied automatically with the use of this macro package, however
the macros are still listed for the sake of completeness.  Alongside the traps
set, the font size and vertical spacing are set to 12 point and double
respectively, and output justification and hyphenation are both disabled.
